#+title: Bang.el

DuckDuckGo-style [[https://duckduckgo.com/bang][bangs]] for [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/][Emacs]]

* Installation
First, install [[https://github.com/domtronn/all-the-icons.el][all-the-icons]] for pretty icons. Then, use [[https://github.com/radian-software/straight.el][straight.el]]
to install the package.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package bang
    :straight
    (bang :host github :repo "Arian-D/bang.el"))
#+end_src

* Usage
Try ~M-x !~, and then go on from there ðŸ™‚

* Configuration
** Adding bangs
All the "bangs" are kept in the ~!bangs~ variable. A simple ~C-h v !bangs~
would show you the current value, and how it is structured, which is
just an [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Association-Lists.html][alist]].

Let's say you want to add a new bang for [[https://www.justwatch.com/][JustWatch]]. It would look
something like this
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (add-to-list '!bangs
               '("jwh" . ("JustWatch" "https:/justwatch.com/us/search?q=%s")))
#+end_src

You can think of it as a whole list or as nested [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Cons-Cell-Type.html][cons cells]]. The ~car~
is the bang, the ~cadr~ is how you refer to the website, and lastly the
url with the query slot left as ~%s~ which will be passed to [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Formatting-Strings.html][format]].

That's it! Next time you try to run ~M-x !~ you will see it as an
option.

** Default browser
By default, Emacs uses the default browser (duh!). If you want this
behavior to change, you can easily modify the
~browse-url-browser-function~ variable.

For example, let's say your default browser is Firefox, but you'd like
your search results to be opened in Chrome. You can add this to your
config:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (setq browse-url-browser-function #'browse-url-chrome)
#+end_src

** Keybindings
This package intends to be non-intrusive, so _no_ keybindings are set by
default. A simple example to map it to ~C-!~ would be this:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (define-key (current-global-map) (kbd "C-!") #'!)
#+end_src

Another example for [[https://github.com/emacs-evil/evil][evil]] users leveraging ~<leader>~ would be this:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (evil-global-set-key 'normal (kbd "<leader> !") #'!)
#+end_src

* Comments and Limitations
- This is not a clone of DuckDuckGo, meaning this package is not meant to
  replicate duckduckgo's behavior within Emacs (though it can). The
  purpose is to have control over the naming so that it would match
  your workflow.
- Completions don't show up while typing, which is a nice-to-have, but
  sadly most of these websites don't have an open API, have rate
  limiting, and/or require authentication.

* IN-PROGRESS [3/7] Todos

- [ ] Increase the list to include most of the top duckduckgo bangs
- [ ] Switch to a default search engine
- [ ] Add a function/macro to create native functions out of each bang
- [ ] Maybe ~defgroup~?
- [X] Add the configuration section
- [X] Add icons to the ~!bangs~ list
- [X] Fix space formatting
